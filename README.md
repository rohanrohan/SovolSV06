3. [Fan Shroud (Print in ABS or other higher temp resistive materials)](https://www.printables.com/model/410475-sv06-5015-fan-duct-rounded/related)

4. Plus you will need an accelerometer tool for plugging in your resonant frequencies. Plese read the docs but here are some videos from Nero3D for help. [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoWQUcFimX8) [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_VHbT_tsZw&pp=ygURaW5wdXQgc2hhcGVyIHRvb2w%3D)
   Or you can just use the numbers I have and check the results for yourself.

   Make sure you have a clean and mechanically sound machine i.e. tightend fasteners, belts at the correct tension, a good surface for the printer etc.

   Notify me of any missing credits and I will add them.
